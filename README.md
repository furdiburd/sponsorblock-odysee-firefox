# Odysee Sponsor skipper
Skip sponsored segments on Odysee videos imported from YouTube. Firefox extension.

This plugin works only on videos imported (sync) from YouTube. The plugin uses SponsorBlock API. This is a very basic plugin whose purpose is only to load and skip sponsored segments. So, there are no advanced features like statistics, advanced settings, submitting segments...etc. There is a possibility that the plugin will not work with certain videos if the author has changed certain video information. 

This is a fork of the original "sponsorblock-odysee" ported to firefox desktop and mobile + soon to safari (if i can finaly test it on that).

Install from Firefox Web Store: https://addons.mozilla.org/hu/firefox/addon/odysee-sponsor-skipper/
