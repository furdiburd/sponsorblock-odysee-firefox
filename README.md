# sponsorblock odysee for Firefox
Skip sponsored segments on Odysee videos imported from YouTube. Firefox extension.

This plugin works only on videos imported (sync) from YouTube. This is a very basic plugin whose purpose is only to load and skip sponsored segments. So, there are no advanced features like statistics, advanced settings, submitting segments...etc. There is a possibility that the plugin will not work with certain videos if the author has changed certain video information. The plugin uses SponsorBlock API. I'm not a front-end developer so my code isn't the best in the world. Please feel free to improve.

Install from Firefox Web Store: https://addons.mozilla.org
